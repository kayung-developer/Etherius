
## üî• Etherius

**Etherius** is not just another chatbot. It is a comprehensive, full-stack AI platform designed to be a true digital partner. It integrates state-of-the-art AI models for advanced reasoning, tool use, and long-term memory. It's built to be extensible, allowing for the integration of specialized AI agents, IoT devices, and external APIs.

This project demonstrates how to build a commercially-ready AI assistant from the ground up, combining a sophisticated local backend with a sleek, modern UI.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Etherius is packed with revolutionary features that set it apart:

üß† **True Multimodal Intelligence**: Understands and generates text and code, and analyzes images.
*   **Core LLM**: Powered by `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1` for superior reasoning.
*   **Image Analysis**: Uses the `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large` model to understand images.
*   **Voice I/O**: High-quality Speech-to-Text (`openai/whisper-large-v3`) and Text-to-Speech (`microsoft/speecht5_tts`).

üõ†Ô∏è **Autonomous Tool & Agent System**: Etherius can decide when to use tools or delegate complex tasks to specialized agents.
*   **Tools**: Web Search, Code Execution, Image Analysis, Email Sending.
*   **Agents**: Includes a `MarketingAgent`, `CybersecurityAgent`, and `CryptoAgent`.

üìö **Hyper-Contextual Memory**:
*   **Short-Term**: A rolling conversation buffer for immediate context.
*   **Long-Term**: A persistent **Vector Database** (ChromaDB) stores key memories, allowing the AI to recall facts and preferences from past conversations.

üîê **User & Subscription Management**:
*   **Full Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system.
*   **Subscription Tiers**: Supports Basic, Premium, and Ultimate plans, unlocking different features.
*   **Payment Integration**: Fully integrated with **Paystack** for handling subscription payments, including a backend webhook server.

ü§ñ **Extensible & Future-Ready**:
*   **Robotics/IoT Interface**: Includes a ready-to-use MQTT interface for controlling real-world devices.
*   **Blockchain Integration**: The `CryptoAgent` can interact with the Ethereum blockchain via a public RPC.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI (for webhooks)
*   **Desktop GUI**: PyQt5, QtWebEngine (rendering HTML/CSS/JS)
*   **AI Models**: PyTorch, Hugging Face (Transformers, Sentence-Transformers)
*   **Databases**: SQLite (for user data), ChromaDB (for vector memory)
*   **Audio**: SoundDevice, PyAudio
*   **APIs**: Paystack, Serper.dev

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.9+**
*   **NVIDIA GPU with >= 24GB VRAM** (Critically important for running the Mixtral model)
*   **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** (version compatible with PyTorch, e.g., 11.8)
*   A microphone for voice input.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Etherius.git
cd Etherius
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

You can install all required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: The PyTorch installation within `requirements.txt` is CPU-only by default for compatibility. For GPU support, which is **required**, please install the correct version manually first.)*

**For GPU Support (Required for decent performance):**
Find your CUDA version and install the correct PyTorch package from the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For CUDA 11.8, the command is:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

</p>

### 4. Configure API Keys

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and populate it with your secret keys. A template is provided below.

```env
# --- Hugging Face (Required) ---
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token_here"

# --- Web Search (Optional but Recommended) ---
SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_dev_api_key_here"

# --- Payment Gateway (Optional) ---
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# --- Email Sending (Optional) ---
SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password_here"

# --- Crypto Agent (Optional) ---
ETHEREUM_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_project_id_here"
```

### 5. Run the Application

With your virtual environment active, run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
**First-time startup will be very long**, as the application needs to download several large AI models (50GB+). Subsequent startups will be much faster.
